# avamae-technical-assessment
The Avamae project involves building a responsive, single-page React web application with three key sections:

- Home Page: Displays static content and a carousel that dynamically fetches images and strapline text from an external REST API.
- About Us Page: Contains static text and imagery.
- Contact Us Page: Features a form to collect user details, validated before submission to an external REST API, with appropriate feedback for success or failure.
  
The app includes a consistent navigation bar, a footer, and responsive layouts for desktop and mobile. It uses modern React practices, external CSS for styling, and a routing library to simulate navigation.
